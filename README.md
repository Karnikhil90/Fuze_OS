# Fuze_OS
**Fuze OS** is an operating system based on the .ino file format for Arduino platforms. Unlike NetMaster OS (my project based on MicroPython), Fuze OS uses dynamic RAM allocation via an SD card system. It includes essential tools and can read .bin files directly from the SD card, enabling seamless project expansion and efficient memory management.
